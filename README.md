# KobeBryantShotPrediction

This project is a data analysis and machine learning exercise in order to attempt to predict whether Kobe Bryant will make a shot based off of different characteristics such as type of shot, area from floor, period, time left in the quarter, opponent, and more. The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/data), and contains statistics regarding every single shot Kobe Bryant attempted during his 20-year career. 

After initial data processing and manipulation, I used the tensorflow and keras frameworks in order to build a neural network that attempts to learn from the different features. The model results approached _ % accuracy on the training set, _ % accuracy on the validation set, and _ % accuracy on the test set. The very nature of this project was a simple learning exercise, and the model may not have been as predictive as wished because intuitively, the only factors that potentially impact whether Kobe makes a shot or not is the type of shot, area from floor, and potentially the opponent or year (given that his prime was in the mid-2000's). After this, there is significant variability and randomness inherent in this dataset, which could very well explain the relatively low accuracy of the model.
